- 👋 Hi, I’m @MerkabaToken

- 👀 I’m interested in developing a token in which generates enough circulation to a point it gets readily accepted
as a currency such as bitcoin, Eth, bnb, ada and so forth. Latter is we have a growing collective which one day soon
we hope holders can purchase stock with our token... but then also make purchases elsewhere too

- 🌱 Website has been released! https://merkaba-token.io

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all fronts, please don't hesitate to reach out!

- 📫 How to reach me: You find me easiest to reach here via email, merkabatoken@outlook.com
